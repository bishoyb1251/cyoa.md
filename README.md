# Choose Your Own Adventure
## Demo
## context ## 
The purpose of creating this repository was to allow people who like basketball to be able to learn how to deal with the real (not real) world. It was also made to allow people to make good real life descions. The prompt that me and my partner Andre wanted to do was basketball since me and him were on the basketball team toghter!

## reflection ## 
Some challenges I faced while doing this big project was communacation because my partner had switched classes and had gotten injured so it was a challenge to be able to get a right vision of what each other wanted to be able to focus on. Another challenge I had faced was making the site not crash. I say this because if I ended up doing something right another thing crashed. For example I pit pushed a page and it worked but the page to go to the whole thing had crashed. A few things I took away from this project was that I learned how to communicate even better so thats amazing. I also learned a few codes that I should have learned in the beggining of the year but I didnt like for example touch. Some next steps I have to do is make sure to be able to not struggle as much as I did on this project. For example I can focus in class a little more so I can be able to do the code better without getting confused.
